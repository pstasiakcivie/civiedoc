## Methods of Report Dictation

Users can dictate reports using one of the following methods:

### 1. CIVR Custom Speech Engine / System Microphone

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Dictation">
    Click the **Mic** icon to activate dictation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Dictation">
    The **Dictation Box** appears, allowing users to start dictating.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop Dictation">
    Click the **Mic** icon again to stop dictation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Auto-Correction Feature

1. This feature is available only in CIVR Custom Speech Engine.
2. The system learns from past corrections to improve future transcriptions.
3. If a word is incorrectly transcribed, users can replace it with the correct term.
4. The system automatically applies learned corrections in future reports, enhancing accuracy.

### Auto-Correction via Right-Click

1. Right-clicking on a word displays the Replace and Save option.
2. Users can replace a word with an alternative and save it for future corrections.
3. If the same statement appears in future dictations, the system automatically replaces the word based on saved preferences.

### External VR Devices (Olympus Mic & Philips Speech Mic)

1. Users with enabled External VR Settings can dictate using Olympus or Philips microphones.
2. These devices allow navigation and shortcut customization via the Settings tab.
3. Voice commands and button shortcuts on the device help streamline the dictation process.

### Manual Report Entry

1. Users can manually type reports directly into the Report Editor.
2. Copy-pasting text into the editor triggers a disclaimer message to notify users about potential formatting issues.

## Report Dictation Modes

**CIVR** provides two different approaches to dictation:

### Template-Based Mode

1. The system automatically loads predefined templates based on study type (location, modality, procedure).
2. If multiple templates are available, users can select the most suitable one.
3. Users can customize templates before dictating and finalizing the report.

### AI-Augmented Dictation Mode

#### Nitro Mode (Enabled in Settings)

1. Displays both the AI-augmented dictation and template-based window.
2. Users dictate key findings, and the system auto-generates the entire report based on mapped templates.
3. The system applies AI-based formatting, ensuring consistency across reports.

#### Turbo Mode (Enabled in Settings; based on findings)

Turbo Mode enhances the dictation experience by enabling both AI-augmented and Template-based dictation tabs simultaneously. This mode intelligently reacts to dictated findings to streamline impression generation.

1. If Auto-Impression is enabled, Impressions are auto-populated upon dictating findings.
2. If Auto-Impression is disabled, users must manually enter impressions.

**Restrict AI Report in Addendum Mode:** To maintain the integrity and accuracy of finalized reports, AI-generated reports are restricted in Addendum mode. This means that once a report has been signed off and is being accessed for an addendum, the content generated by the AI (CIVR) cannot be modified or reused. Physicians must manually dictate any additional findings or corrections in the addendum section.

**Critical or Incidental Findings Notification: **As part of quality assurance, CIVR analyzes dictated content in real-time. If any critical or incidental findings are detected based on the dictated report, the system automatically prompts the user with an on-screen notification alert, ensuring that such findings are not missed or underreported. This feature is designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support regulatory compliance.

## Reviewing and Finalizing Reports

/Once dictation is complete, users can review the report by clicking the Preview icon. Preview the dictated text and make necessary edits.

After reviewing the report, users can Sign, Draft, or Close the report using any of the following methods:

1. **Using Buttons**

Sign: Marks the report as complete and final. Once signed, the report cannot be modified.

<Note>
  Clicking Sign prompts a confirmation alert. Once confirmed, the report enters a hold state for two minutes before being permanently marked as signed.\
  If the user makes any updates within these two-minutes window, the report can still be edited before the final lock-in.
</Note>

**Draft:** Temporarily saves the report for future modifications.\
**Close:** Exits the report without saving and redirects the user back to the Worklist.

<Note>
  If there are some changes made to the report and a user still chooses to Close it, in such a case an alert pops up on the screen as shown below to discard the changes.
</Note>

2. **Using Right-Click Options on the Report Editor**

**Draft:** Save the current version without finalizing.\
**Sign**: Complete and lock the report to prevent further edits.

3. **Using Keyboard Shortcuts**

| Action | Shortcut  |
| ------ | --------- |

## Draft Recovery & Report Management Options

CIVR offers robust features to ensure report safety and editing flexibility during the dictation process.

**Auto-Save & Restore Report**

CIVR automatically saves your work at regular intervals during dictation. If the report window is accidentally closed or crashes, the **Restore Report** feature allows you to recover the entire session—including all dictated text and edits—ensuring that no data is lost.

**Draft & Deletion Recovery (Available for 24 Hours)**

All drafts and deleted reports are retained for up to 24 hours. Within this period, users can:

1. **Delete Draft:** Permanently remove an unwanted draft.
2. \*\*Restore Draft: \*\*Recover autosaved content from an incomplete session.
3. \*\*Discard Changes: \*\*Revert to the last manually saved version of the report, discarding any recent unsaved edits.
4. **Restore Deleted Draft:** Retrieve a previously deleted report if it’s still within the 24-hour window.

**Acquire Ownership of a Report**

If a user attempts to open a report that was previously drafted by another user, it opens in **Result Pending** mode. A system prompt—“**Acquire ownership of this report**”—will appear. To begin editing, the user must accept the prompt.

<Warning>
  Only one user can actively edit a report at any time to avoid data conflicts.
</Warning>

**Dislike Template Option**

When a user dislikes an auto-mapped template, the system will no longer load that template automatically for similar cases. Instead, it will fetch and load an alternative from the related template list, improving personalization without disrupting workflow.

**Default Template Handling**

If no report template is manually imported during dictation, CIVR automatically loads the **CI Standard Universal Template** or the user’s saved default template, ensuring a consistent report structure. This auto-load functionality eliminates unnecessary delays and standardizes documentation across providers.
