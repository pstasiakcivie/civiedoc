## Report Dictation Modes

CIVR provides two different approaches to dictation:

### 1. Template-Based Mode

- The system automatically loads predefined templates based on study type (location, modality, procedure).
- If multiple templates are available, users can select the most suitable one.
- Users can customize templates before dictating and finalizing the report.

### 2. AI-Augmented Dictation Mode

#### Nitro Mode (Enabled in Settings)

- Displays both the AI-augmented dictation and template-based window.
- Users dictate key findings, and the system auto-generates the entire report based on mapped templates.
- The system applies AI-based formatting, ensuring consistency across reports.

#### Turbo Mode (Enabled in Settings; based on findings)

Turbo Mode enhances the dictation experience by enabling both AI-augmented and Template-based dictation tabs simultaneously. This mode intelligently reacts to dictated findings to streamline impression generation.

- If **Auto-Impression** is enabled, Impressions are auto-populated upon dictating findings.
- If **Auto-Impression** is disabled, users must manually enter impressions.

> - **Restrict AI Report in Addendum Mode**: To maintain the integrity and accuracy of finalized reports, AI-generated reports are restricted in Addendum mode. This means that once a report has been signed off and is being accessed for an addendum, the content generated by the AI (CIVR) cannot be modified or reused. Physicians must manually dictate any additional findings or corrections in the addendum section.
> - **Critical or Incidental Findings Notification**: As part of quality assurance, CIVR analyzes dictated content in real-time. If any critical or incidental findings are detected based on the dictated report, the system automatically prompts the user with an on-screen notification alert, ensuring that such findings are not missed or underreported. This feature is designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support regulatory compliance.
