## 1. Introduction

CI’s Voice Recognition (CIVR) enhances transcription efficiency by enabling real-time dictation editing through its advanced speech recognition engine. Users' edits continuously refine the speech recognition dictionary, improving transcription accuracy over time.

With this solution, users can efficiently view, edit, and sign reports, significantly accelerating the documentation process. CIVR also supports configurable rules to accommodate facilities that require multiple signatures.

### Key Features of AI-Based Dictation

- **Adaptive Learning**: The AI engine refines its speech recognition capabilities based on user inputs, improving accuracy over time.
- **Automated Critical Findings Detection**: Automatically identifies and inserts critical findings into reports, ensuring vital information is not overlooked.
- **Auto-Populated Impressions**: Generates structured impressions based on dictated findings, reducing documentation time.
- **AI-Based Report Template Suggestions**: Suggests appropriate report templates based on the location, modality, procedure codes, and description, maintaining consistency and standardization.

With these AI-powered enhancements, radiologists can seamlessly dictate, edit, and sign reports while ensuring detailed and up to the mark reports without overlooking any critical cases and minimizing human errors.

CIVR also supports multiple workflow integrations and customizable rules to accommodate facilities. The solution ensures comprehensive data capture and analytics, enabling timely and accurate diagnostic reporting.
