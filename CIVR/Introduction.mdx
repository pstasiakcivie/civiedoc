<Info>
  CI’s Voice Recognition (CIVR) enhances transcription efficiency by enabling real-time dictation editing through its advanced speech recognition engine. Users' edits continuously refine the speech recognition dictionary, improving transcription accuracy over time.

With this solution, users can efficiently view, edit, and sign reports, significantly accelerating the documentation process. CIVR also supports configurable rules to accommodate facilities that require multiple signatures.

## Key Features of AI-Based Dictation

The **Adaptive Learning** capability allows the AI engine to refine its speech recognition accuracy over time based on user interactions and corrections.

The **Automated Critical Findings Detection** feature ensures that vital information is never missed by automatically identifying and inserting critical findings directly into the report.

With **Auto-Populated Impressions**, the system generates structured impressions from dictated findings, helping reduce the time spent on manual documentation.

The **AI-Based Report Template Suggestions** feature recommends appropriate templates based on the location, modality, procedure codes, and description, helping maintain consistency and standardisation across reports.

<Note>
  These AI-powered enhancements allow radiologists to seamlessly dictate, edit, and sign reports while ensuring high-quality documentation. This minimises human error and ensures that no critical cases are overlooked.
</Note>

CIVR supports multiple workflow integrations and includes flexible rule configuration to suit various facility requirements. It ensures comprehensive data capture and analytics for timely and accurate diagnostic reporting.
