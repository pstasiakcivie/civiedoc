The Preferences section in CIVR allows users to personalize their dictation environment to match individual workflow styles, comfort, and system integration needs. These settings cover visual layout, dictation workflow, AI behavior, hardware support, and general application preferences.

#### Preferences Configuration ‚Äì Summary Table

**Steps to Open and Configure Preferences**

Click the **Settings** tab and select **Preference**. Use the dropdown sections to expand each category (e.g., Editor, AI Features, Application Preferences).

| Section                         | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Editor Preferences**          | Set your preferred background and field colors for the dictation window. Adjust line and paragraph spacing to improve readability. Change font size and picklist delimiters. Optionally, hide the right pane automatically during dictation.                                                           |
| **Dictation Workflow Settings** | Set how many comparisons appear in reports. Enable auto-numbering for impressions. Automatically load original reports when adding addendums. Show a warning before signing reports. Enable auto-draft to save progress during dictation. Choose whether to show impressions at the top of the report. |
| **AI Features**                 | Select the dictation engine (e.g., CIVR Custom Speech). Enable AI modes: Default Mode includes report correction and template matching. Turbo Mode auto-generates impressions and documents critical findings. Nitro Mode creates full reports from key findings.                                      |
| **Hardware Support**            | Enable support for gaming mice. Configure external microphones. Set Push/Hold-to-Talk behavior if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Application Preferences**     | Use Safe Mode for a simplified version of CIVR. Disable the CIVR setup wizard if you don't want to see it again.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Resetting Preferences**       | Click Reset All to quickly revert all settings to their original defaults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Best Practices**

- ‚úîÔ∏è Enable Auto Drafting to prevent accidental data loss during interruptions. A study can be accessed by only one user at a time; if the dictation window is closed without signing, the study will automatically move to Result Pending status.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Use Turbo Mode for a balance of automation and customization.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Disable Nitro Mode if full AI-driven reporting isn't needed.
