description: "Explanation of how CIVR handles open orders, prior reports, and auto-filled structured reports for radiology studies."
---

## OPEN ORDERS

If there are any other studies present for the selected patient, such studies are present under **Open Orders**.

All these open orders can be signed altogether.

---

## PRIOR REPORT

If there is a prior report for the selected study, then it can be viewed here in the **CIVRâ€™s - Prior report** section as shown below:

Users have multiple options when working with previously generated reports:

- **Open Prior Report**: View the original report associated with the selected study.
- **Copy Prior Report**: Copy the content from a prior report for reference or reuse.
- **Clone Prior Report**: Duplicate a previous report structure to use as a starting point for a new report.

Additionally, users can view prior reports in two modes:

- **Condensed Mode**: Displays a simplified view for quick reference.
- **Original Mode**: Shows the full report in its original formatting and layout.

## STRUCTURE REPORT

If a structured report is available for the selected study, it will appear under the **Structure Report** section. The values from the structured report are automatically populated into the current report, eliminating the need to manually enter them again.
