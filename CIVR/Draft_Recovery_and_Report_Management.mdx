## Draft Recovery & Report Management Options

CIVR offers robust features to ensure report safety and editing flexibility during the dictation process.

### • Auto-Save & Restore Report
CIVR automatically saves your work at regular intervals during dictation. If the report window is accidentally closed or crashes, the **Restore Report** feature allows you to recover the entire session—including all dictated text and edits—ensuring that no data is lost.

### • Draft & Deletion Recovery (Available for 24 Hours)
All drafts and deleted reports are retained for up to **24 hours**. Within this period, users can:

- **Delete Draft**: Permanently remove an unwanted draft.
- **Restore Draft**: Recover autosaved content from an incomplete session.
- **Discard Changes**: Revert to the last manually saved version of the report, discarding any recent unsaved edits.
- **Restore Deleted Draft**: Retrieve a previously deleted report if it’s still within the 24-hour window.

### • Acquire Ownership of a Report
If a user attempts to open a report that was previously drafted by another user, it opens in **Result Pending** mode. A system prompt—“**Acquire ownership of this report**”—will appear. To begin editing, the user must accept the prompt.

⚠️ **Only one user can actively edit a report at any time to avoid data conflicts.**

### • Dislike Template Option
When a user dislikes an auto-mapped template, the system will no longer load that template automatically for similar cases. Instead, it will fetch and load an alternative from the related template list, improving personalization without disrupting workflow.

### • Default Template Handling
If no report template is manually imported during dictation, CIVR automatically loads the **CI Standard Universal Template** or the user’s saved **default template**, ensuring a consistent report structure. This auto-load functionality eliminates unnecessary delays and standardizes documentation across providers.
