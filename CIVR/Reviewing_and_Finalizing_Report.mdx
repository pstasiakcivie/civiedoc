## Reviewing and Finalizing Reports

Once dictation is complete, users can review the report by clicking the **Preview icon**. Preview the dictated text and make necessary edits.

---

## Finalizing the Report

After reviewing the report, users can **Sign**, **Draft**, or **Close** the report using any of the following methods:

### 1. Using Buttons

- **Sign**: Marks the report as complete and final. Once signed, the report cannot be modified.

> **NOTE:**
>
> - Clicking **Sign** prompts a confirmation alert. Once confirmed, the report enters a hold state for two minutes before being permanently marked as signed.
> - If the user makes any updates within this two-minute window, the report can still be edited before the final lock-in.

- **Draft**: Temporarily saves the report for future modifications.
- **Close**: Exits the report without saving and redirects the user back to the Worklist.

> **NOTE:** If there are some changes made to the report and a user still chooses to **Close** it, an alert pops up on the screen to discard the changes.

### 2. Using Right-Click Options on the Report Editor

- **Draft**: Save the current version without finalizing.
- **Sign**: Complete and lock the report to prevent further edits.

### 3. Using Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut  |
| ------ | --------- |
| Draft  | Ctrl \+ D |
| Sign   | Ctrl \+ S |

This streamlined workflow enhances efficiency, accuracy, and user control when creating and finalizing radiology reports in RadFlow.

Users can right-click on the **Report Editor** screen to access additional functionalities:

- **Text Editing**: Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste as Plain Text, Select All.
- **Settings & Close**: Access dictation settings or close the report.
- **Save As Template**: Allows users to create a new template from an existing report template. The **Save As Template** option helps preserve the original template while saving a customized template for future use.
