2. (Optional) Add comments for context or clarification.

![Picture55 Pn](/images/Picture55.png)

1. Click the Submit button.
2. Click the Cancel button to discard the changes.

> üìå **Note:**
>
> - When a record is marked as CAP, it is removed from the active coding queue, and its coding status updates to CAP. This change is also reflected in the Activity tab.
> - The report is automatically routed to the CAP portal for physician review. If the physician responds via the Discussion Panel in the CAP portal, the message appears in the Discussion tab of the Coding module for the coder or manager to review.
> - If the physician takes any of the following actions in the CAP portal‚ÄîAddendum in the Hospital System, No Change, Sign Change, or Sign Anyway‚Äîthe CAP status is updated to Addendum, and the corresponding status in the Coding module changes to In Progress. It is also reflected in the Activity tab.
> - If the CAP record expires without physician action, its status in the CAP portal becomes Expired, and the Coding module updates the record‚Äôs status back to In Progress.
> - If a coder manager flags a record as CAP and the physician reassigns it to a coder who then raises a question via the CAP Discussion Panel, the Days to Expire status changes to In Coder‚Äôs Queue. If the coder manager or admin reverts the record, the expiration timer resets to the Default days to expire in the CAP portal.
