title: "Coding"
description: "The Coding module streamlines healthcare billing by converting medical data into standardized CPT and ICD codes. It enables coders to efficiently manage workflows, review documentation, assign accurate codes, flag discrepancies (CAP), and collaborate with physicians. Built-in quality checks help reduce errors and denials. Users can also create private or shared worklists to organize tasks by priority and team needs. "

The **Coding** Dashboard provides users with a centralized view of their coding activities, allowing them to track daily performance, view worklists, and access reports based on status. This helps prioritize tasks and ensures efficient workflow management.

**The Coding Dashboard gives a quick summary of your coding activity and worklists:**

- **Your Daily Progress**: Shows how many records you’ve completed today and the total RVUs.
- **Coding Bucket**: A pie chart showing report counts Pending, Submitted, CAP, and Disabled.
- **Daily Client Activity**: Displays the number of new and completed reports by client.
- **My Private Worklist**: Lists your personal worklists based on status like New, In Progress, Approved, etc.
- **Shared Worklist**: Shows shared worklists (if available) for team collaboration.

**Chart Details Panel**

This panel provides key metadata about the coding record for context and verification:

![2025 07 23 18 02 48 Pn](/images/2025-07-23_18-02-48.png)

**Identifiers:** Record ID, MRN, Accession Number, Procedure Description

**Provider Information**: Billing Provider, Ordering Physician

**Service Details:** Date of Service (DOS), Signed Date, Location, Place of Service (POS)

**Status and Billing:** Coding Status, Reason for Study, Carrier

**Entering CPT and NDC Information**

<Steps>
  <Step title="CPT Code Entry">
    Users must enter one or more **Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)** codes as mentioned in the report.

    ![7 Pn](/images/7.png)

    **CPT Code:** Enter the appropriate procedure code.

    **Procedure Description:** Auto-filled based on the selected CPT.

    **Modifiers (M1–M4):** Add up to four modifiers for billing specificity.

    **Units:** Specify the number of units for each CPT.

    **ICD POS:** Indicate the ICD Place of Service as required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding multiple CPT codes (if required)" stepNumber={2}>
    **Add CPT :** Click the **\+** icon to add a new CPT entry.

    **Delete CPT :** Click the **Delete** icon to remove a CPT entry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="NDC Entry " stepNumber={3}>
    To associate a National Drug Code (NDC) with a CPT entry:

    ![3 Pn](/images/8.png)

    Click the **NDC/Unit** icon next to the desired CPT row to open the NDC Entry Panel.\
    \
    **NDC Code:** Select from the dropdown list.

    **NDC Unit:** Specify the quantity administered.

    Alternatively, click the <Icon icon="check" /> icon to manually confirm.

    <Note>
      **Note**:

      If NDC codes are pre-linked to the selected CPT, they may auto-populate.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**ICD Code Entry**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Manual ICD Entry Without CPT">
    You can assign **ICD-10 diagnosis codes** based on the selected **CPT code** and the related patient report documentation.

    **Auto-Suggested ICDs**: When a CPT code is selected, the system automatically suggests relevant ICD-10 codes. Click the **\+ icon** next to a suggested code to add it.

    **Manual ICD Entry**: If suitable ICD codes are not suggested, you can manually enter custom ICD-10 codes in the provided input fields.

    <Tip>
      **Best Practice:** Ensure all manually entered ICDs are accurate and mapped correctly to the patient diagnosis.
    </Tip>
    <Note>
      **Note:** Duplicate ICD codes are not allowed. The system supports a maximum of 12 unique ICD entries per record.

**Marking a Record for Coding Assistance (CAP)**

Use the CAP feature when physician input or clarification is needed for a coding report.

<Steps>
  <Step title="To mark a record as CAP">
    Click the **CAP** button at the top right corner of the right panel.

    ![9 Pn](/images/9.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a CAP Reason from the dropdown.">

    ![10 Pn](/images/10.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit or Cancel">
    Click the **Submit** button to mark the record as a **Coding Assistance Portal (CAP)** request.

    Click the **Cancel** button to discard any changes and exit without submitting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Note**

  - When a record is marked as CAP, it is removed from the active coding queue, and its coding status updates to CAP. This change is also reflected in the Activity tab.
  - The report is automatically routed to the CAP portal for physician review. If the physician responds via the Discussion Panel in the CAP portal, the message appears in the Discussion tab of the Coding module for the coder or manager to review.
  - If the physician takes any of the following actions in the CAP portal—Addendum in the Hospital System, No Change, Sign Change, or Sign Anyway—the CAP status is updated to Addendum, and the corresponding status in the Coding module changes to In Progress. It is also reflected in the Activity tab.
  - If the CAP record expires without physician action, its status in the CAP portal becomes Expired, and the Coding module updates the record’s status back to In Progress.
  - If a coder manager flags a record as CAP and the physician reassigns it to a coder who then raises a question via the CAP Discussion Panel, the Days to Expire status changes to In Coder’s Queue. If the coder manager or admin reverts the record, the expiration timer resets to the Default days to expire in the CAP portal.
