title: "Coding"
description: "The Coding module streamlines healthcare billing by converting medical data into standardized CPT and ICD codes. It enables coders to efficiently manage workflows, review documentation, assign accurate codes, flag discrepancies (CAP), and collaborate with physicians. Built-in quality checks help reduce errors and denials. Users can also create private or shared worklists to organize tasks by priority and team needs. "

The **Coding** Dashboard provides users with a centralized view of their coding activities, allowing them to track daily performance, view worklists, and access reports based on status. This helps prioritize tasks and ensures efficient workflow management.

**The Coding Dashboard gives a quick summary of your coding activity and worklists:**

- **Your Daily Progress**: Shows how many records you’ve completed today and the total RVUs.
- **Coding Bucket**: A pie chart showing report counts Pending, Submitted, CAP, and Disabled.
- **Daily Client Activity**: Displays the number of new and completed reports by client.
- **My Private Worklist**: Lists your personal worklists based on status like New, In Progress, Approved, etc.
- **Shared Worklist**: Shows shared worklists (if available) for team collaboration.

**Marking a Record for Coding Assistance (CAP)**

Use the CAP feature when physician input or clarification is needed for a coding report.

<Steps>
  <Step title="To mark a record as CAP">
    Click the CAP button at the top right corner of the right panel.

    ![9 Pn](/images/9.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a CAP Reason from the dropdown.">
    (Optional) Add comments for context or clarification.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Cancel">
    Click the **Cancel** button to discard the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Note**

  - When a record is marked as CAP, it is removed from the active coding queue, and its coding status updates to CAP. This change is also reflected in the Activity tab.
  - The report is automatically routed to the CAP portal for physician review. If the physician responds via the Discussion Panel in the CAP portal, the message appears in the Discussion tab of the Coding module for the coder or manager to review.
  - If the physician takes any of the following actions in the CAP portal—Addendum in the Hospital System, No Change, Sign Change, or Sign Anyway—the CAP status is updated to Addendum, and the corresponding status in the Coding module changes to In Progress. It is also reflected in the Activity tab.
  - If the CAP record expires without physician action, its status in the CAP portal becomes Expired, and the Coding module updates the record’s status back to In Progress.
  - If a coder manager flags a record as CAP and the physician reassigns it to a coder who then raises a question via the CAP Discussion Panel, the Days to Expire status changes to In Coder’s Queue. If the coder manager or admin reverts the record, the expiration timer resets to the Default days to expire in the CAP portal.
