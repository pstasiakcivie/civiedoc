\##**Facesheet**

Facesheets play a vital role in healthcare billing systems as these documents contains comprehensive patient information which is extracted by our users and fed into the system, further this information is used for billing, insurance processing, medical treatment, and administrative tasks. They help streamline workflows, improve accuracy in billing processes.

Below are step-by-step instructions outlining the key activities users can perform within the Facesheets tab, facilitating effective management associated with them.

## **Coding**

Medical coding is essential for healthcare billing systems as it converts medical operations, diagnoses, treatments, and services into standardized codes (CPT and ICD).  Creating a coding worklist enables users to prioritize and manage coding tasks efficiently. These worklists can be shared or private as per the requirement.
Coding dashboard is shown so that user can review the coding worklist, track the progress of coding tasks, and ensure that priorities are being addressed in a timely manner.

![image.png](/.attachments/image-d4172b41-5519-4c37-adf1-f3c2e6288db4.png)

**Coding Dashboard**
The Coding Dashboard is designed to allow users to review the coding worklist, track the progress of coding tasks, and ensure that priorities are being addressed in a timely manner. Below are the key elements and their descriptions:
·       **Your Daily Progress:** Displays the count of total records submitted today along with their corresponding Relative Value Units (RVUs).
·       **Coding Bucket:** Highlights report counts by category: pending, submitted, flagged for CAP, and disabled.
·       **Daily Client Activity:** Displays the number of records successfully completed each day, along with the count of records added on the same day.

**Quick Access for Navigating to Worklist Records:**
·       **All:** Includes every coding record in the system, regardless of its status.
·       **New:** Shows records that have been recently created.
·       **In Progress:** Displays records currently being processed or reviewed but are not yet complete.
Here's how to navigate within the Coding tab.

**Step 1:** **MY PRIVATE WORK-LIST**: All the private coding worklists added by the user for personalized tasks and activities are listed here.

*If no worklist is assigned, a message is shown on the screen "No Worklist Assigned!!".*
select the checkbox to enable the Mark as a private worklist, which is only private for you

**Step 2:** **SHARED WORK-LIST:** All the shared coding worklists added by the user for collaborative tasks and activities are listed here.

* Click on Create User Group to  create new user groups.

*If no worklist is assigned, a message is shown on the screen "No Worklist Assigned!!".*

## **Common**

Healthcare coding refers to the process of assigning standardized codes to medical diagnoses, procedures, and services. These codes are used for various purposes, including billing, insurance claims, and data analysis.

### **Code**

In healthcare, there are various common codes (for example reason codes or remark codes etc.) are used to provide additional information or clarification about specific events or transactions, especially in the context of claim processing, billing, and reimbursement. These codes help to communicate the reasons behind certain actions, denials, or adjustments in a standardized manner. Codes are an integral part of electronic transactions and are often included in the explanation of benefits (EOB) or remittance advice (RA) documents, etc. The code section here resembles the common codes to be used throughout the Rad Billing application.
