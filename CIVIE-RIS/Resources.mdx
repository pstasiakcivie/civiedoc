description: "The Resources module helps manage and organize diagnostic equipment or exam rooms (e.g., MRI, CT, Ultrasound) by location and modality. Users can activate or deactivate resources, define operational hours for each day, and set custom working and break times. The interface offers filters by resource name, location, modality, creator, and creation date. This module ensures efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and workflow management by aligning available equipment with scheduling demands."
