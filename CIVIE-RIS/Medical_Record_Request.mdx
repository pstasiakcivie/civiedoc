It provides a categorized, filterable worklist where requests are organized by status—New, Processing, Failed, Completed, and Cancelled. Users can create, edit, and fulfill requests, define delivery preferences (email, fax, text, or in-person), and specify delivery contacts. This module ensures secure and efficient handling of patient record retrieval and delivery while maintaining full traceability and accountability."
