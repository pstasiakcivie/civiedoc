description: "The Radiology Reports module manages the delivery and status of radiology reports. Users can track the transmission of reports, filter based on delivery status, and take necessary actions for failed or incomplete reports."
---

**Send Report:** Initiates or re-initiates the delivery of the radiology report to the intended recipient via the selected method (e.g., fax, email, portal).\
Used when a report is ready to be sent or needs to be resent after a failed attempt.

> <Icon icon="presentation-screen" iconType="duotone" color="#070707" size="22" /> **Requeue**: Places the report back into the delivery queue for another delivery attempt. Useful when a report has failed or timed out and you want the system to retry sending it.

> <Icon icon="file-export" iconType="duotone" color="#070707" size="22" /> **Move to External Queue**: Transfers the report to a separate queue designated for **external systems or partners** (e.g., third-party vendors, referring clinics). Often used when internal delivery is not applicable or the recipient is outside the primary network.

> <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" iconType="duotone" color="#090808" size="22" />  **Move to Invalid Queue**: Marks the report as **invalid or unprocessable** and moves it to the Invalid Queue. Typically used when data is incorrect, missing, or the recipient information is invalid. This action helps exclude these reports from normal processing and follow-up.

> <Icon icon="hand-holding-box" iconType="duotone" color="#010101" size="22" /> **Resolve**: Closes or marks a report issue as addressed.\
> Use this when:
>
> - A failed delivery has been manually handled,
> - A report was sent through an alternative method,
> - Or no further action is needed.
>
> Once resolved, the report is no longer flagged for action in the worklist.

> <Icon icon="eye" iconType="duotone" color="#030303" size="22" /> **View Report:** After clicking the <Icon icon="eye" iconType="duotone" /> **icon**, the system opens a **PDF preview panel** where you can:
