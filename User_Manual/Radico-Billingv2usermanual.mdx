## **Coding**

Medical coding is essential for healthcare billing systems as it converts medical operations, diagnoses, treatments, and services into standardized codes (CPT and ICD).  Creating a coding worklist enables users to prioritize and manage coding tasks efficiently. These worklists can be shared or private as per the requirement.
Coding dashboard is shown so that user can review the coding worklist, track the progress of coding tasks, and ensure that priorities are being addressed in a timely manner.

## **Coding Dashboard**

The Coding Dashboard is designed to allow users to review the coding worklist, track the progress of coding tasks, and ensure that priorities are being addressed in a timely manner. Below are the key elements and their descriptions:

- **Your Daily Progress:** Displays the count of total records submitted today along with their corresponding Relative Value Units (RVUs).
- **Coding Bucket:** Highlights report counts by category: pending, submitted, flagged for CAP, and disabled.
- **Daily Client Activity:** Displays the number of records successfully completed each day, along with the count of records added on the same day.

**Quick Access for Navigating to Worklist Records:**

- **All:** Includes every coding record in the system, regardless of its status.
- **New:** Shows records that have been recently created.
- **In Progress:** Displays records currently being processed or reviewed but are not yet complete.
  Here's how to navigate within the Coding tab.
